            <h2>We Help Higschool Students!</h2>
            <p>We strive to provide resources and connect high school students with mentors to prepare them 
            for their post secondary journey</p>
            <p>The Mentorship Spot is directly targeting this issue by 
            providing mentorship and support for students who are leaving high school or entering university</p>
            <p>Guidance from knowledgeable mentors has been shown to smooth the journey 
            from applications through to first year, contributing to higher social integration and academic achievement.</p>
